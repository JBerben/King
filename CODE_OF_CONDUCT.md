# nCOC | no Code Of Conduct

No Code Of Conduct is a groundbreaking new idea.  Designed to help you find communities and projects that will not get stuck endlessly debating how members should behave in their communities, only to be found to never be fully resolved to anyone's liking.

#### What if... we all agreed?

1. We are all adults.  Capable of having adult discussions.

2. We accept everyones contributions, we don't care if you're liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything in between!  In fact, we won't bring it up, or ask.  We simply do not care.

3. Nothing else matters!


#### Q: Great!  How do I add this to my project?

Simply copy CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md into the root directory of your project.  You may modify it to your needs.

#### Q: How do I promote No Code of Conduct?

Feel free to talk about, discuss, and promote No Code of Conduct anywhere you wish, and use the hashtag #NCoC on Twitter.

#### Q: What if, this makes me feel discriminated against?

If you feel this way simply because we do not have a code of conduct, it is hard for anyone to relate to you.  This is not intended to discriminate against anyone.  Simply because we don't babysit people on our site to make sure they treat you with respect, does not mean we hope you feel unwelcome, or that you are treated without respect.  That is just not something we have time for.
